原條文節錄如右：相較於僅提供兩性廁所，提供「三種廁所」可以避免犯罪者假裝性別不安症/跨性別者進入女性廁所犯罪。,"The excerpt from the original article is as follows: Compared with only providing toilets for men and women, providing ""three kinds of toilets"" can prevent criminals from pretending to be gender dysphoria/transgender people to enter women's toilets to commit crimes.","('sd',)"

如果承认价值观因人而异的化，所谓意义又何来统一标准，除非是暴君独裁或自称各类神的代理人，一般人是不会要求他人把意义统一到自己手里。,"If it is recognized that values ​​vary from person to person, how can there be a unified standard of meaning? Unless it is a tyrant or a self-proclaimed agent of various gods, most people will not ask others to unify meaning into their own hands.","('qh',)"
建議應該統一體例，譬如「第15回大會」和「第十五回大會」互見，應該約定採取其中一種。,"It is suggested that the style should be unified. For example, the ""15th Congress"" and the ""Fifteenth Congress"" meet each other, and it should be agreed to adopt one of them.","('sd',)"
又如關卡名稱的翻譯，偶有出入。,"Another example is the translation of the level name, which is occasionally discrepant.","('sd',)"

条目中引用了《尚书·洪范》和《国语》作为五行起源时间的佐证。,"The entry cited ""Shangshu·Hong Fan"" and ""Guoyu"" as evidence of the origin time of the five elements.","('sd',)"
但是，《洪范》已经被认为是伪书，《国语》也有大量后人窜入的内容。,"However, ""Hong Fan"" has been considered a fake book, and ""Guoyu"" also has a lot of content that later generations sneaked in.","('sv',)"
所以，条目中的引文不能当作五行起于西周的证据。,"Therefore, the citations in the entries cannot be taken as evidence that the Five Elements originated in the Western Zhou Dynasty.","('sv',)"

後來，愛因斯坦不服這一弱智定律，並用自己的狹義相對論把它推翻了。,"Later, Einstein refused to accept this mentally retarded law and overturned it with his own special theory of relativity.","('sd',)"

建议移除：“台湾叫做-{聯集}-、大陆叫做-{併集}-。,"Suggested removal: ""Taiwan is called -{United Set}-, and the mainland is called -{United Set}-.","('sd',)"
事实上大宗简体中文文献资料称之为“并集”，“-{併集}-”是文言文用户使用的称谓。,"In fact, a large amount of Simplified Chinese literature is called ""union"", and ""-{union}-"" is the title used by classical Chinese users.","('sd',)"
