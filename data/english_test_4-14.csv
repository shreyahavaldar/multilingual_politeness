"I disagree with the notion that articles on Wikipedia must always use one spelling/phrasing style exclusively for common nouns within them. I don't think the WP: MOS really requires that, and in some cases, that is simply not a practical possibility.",1.6666666666666667

"Twthmoses rightly identifies the three crowns in Eric's union arms as representing the Kalmar Union, and not Sweden. But he objects to the idea that the dividing cross also refers to this union.

"Well, why don't you mosey on over to the Wikipedia page on the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment and your questions will be answered.

The current article has the phrase although other sources attribute the change to a desire to make his name sound less Jewish and then links to a newspaper review of Ryding and Pechefsky.
